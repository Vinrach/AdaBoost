# Boosting-Neural-Networks-for-Enhanced-Classification
An AdaBoost Implementation on Medical Data

# Description
This project implements the AdaBoost algorithm using neural networks as weak learners, with the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset as the test case. The goal is to leverage ensemble learning to improve classification accuracy through boosting. Specifically, the project investigates the performance of neural networks as base classifiers, a deviation from traditional decision trees often used in AdaBoost. The project explores training techniques, including sampling and weighting, to optimize the neural network-based classifiers within the AdaBoost framework. The integration of the AdaBoost algorithm showcases the power of combining multiple weak learners to create a strong classifier that enhances generalization performance.

Key components include:

Machine Learning: Utilization of ensemble methods like AdaBoost to improve prediction accuracy.

Deep Learning: Incorporation of neural networks as weak learners, with experimentation on network architectures and training methods.

Optimization: Application of sampling and cost function weighting techniques to optimize network performance within the AdaBoost framework.
