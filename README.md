# Boosting-Neural-Networks-for-Enhanced-Classification

# Problem Statement:
Implementing the AdaBoost Algorithm with Decision Stumps as Base Learners for Binary Classification on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset

# Description
This project involves building a binary classification model using the AdaBoost algorithm, where the base learners are decision stumps (single-split decision trees). The goal is to combine multiple weak learners to create a strong classifier that can accurately distinguish between benign and malignant tumors in the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset. The implemented model iteratively trains decision stumps on different weighted distributions of the training data, adjusting the weights based on misclassification errors, and aggregates the predictions from each weak learner to produce the final classification decision. The effectiveness of the model is evaluated by experimenting with different numbers of stumps (weak classifiers) and learning rates to identify the best-performing configuration for classifying the breast cancer dataset.
